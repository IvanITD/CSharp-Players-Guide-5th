# Side Quest - Binary and Hexadecimal literals

## ℹ️ Information
So far, the integer literals we have written have all been written using <i>base 10</i>, the normal 10-
digit system humans typically use. But in the programming world, it is occasionally easier to
write out the number using either <i>base 2</i> (binary digits) or <i>base 16</i> (hexadecimal digits, which
are 0 through 9, and then the letters A through F).

To write a binary literal, start your number with a <b>0b</b>. For example:<br>
<blockquote>
int thirteen = 0b00001101;<br>
</blockquote>
For a hexadecimal literal, you start your number with <b>0x</b>:<br>
<blockquote>
int theColorMagenta = 0xFF00FF;<br>
</blockquote>
This example shows one of the places where this might be useful. Colors are often represented
as either six or eight hexadecimal digits.<br>
