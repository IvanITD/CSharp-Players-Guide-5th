Objectives

1. Rebuild the program above on your computer.
2. Add comments near each of the four variables that describe what they store. You must use at least
one of each comment type (// and /* */).
3. Find the bug in the text displayed and fix it. ==> [The bug was the second added "of" word.]
4. Answer this question: Aside from comments, what else could you do to make this code more
understandable? ==> [In order to make this code understandable, we can change the printing style, and instead of using the printing style "Concatenation" we can use the more friendly  approachable way called "Interpolation"]
