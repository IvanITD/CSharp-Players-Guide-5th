# Challenge - The Makings of a Programmer (50 XP)

## ✅ Objectives
- Make a program with 5 <b>Console.WriteLine</b> statements in it.
- <b>Answer this question:</b> How many statements do you think a program can contain?

## ℹ️ Information
The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you to follow him over to a few of his friends, fishing on
the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes
widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen nor heard tell of
anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that
since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.” He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded
One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence
has prevented anybody from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to
stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly
seem doubtful. “Can you show them what you showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to
make a program? Maybe something with more than one statement in it?”

## 📖 Answers
- Created 5 <b>Console.WriteLine</b> statements into a new C# program in a folder next to this readme file
- A program can contain an unlimited amount of statements inside of it. Here's a little more about how much statements can a program actually contain:

🎯 Practical Limits
Small programs: Typically 100 to 1,000 statements.
Medium projects: 10,000+ statements (divided into multiple files).
Large-scale software: Millions of statements, managed through modularization.

💡 Fun Fact
The Windows XP source code (leaked in 2020) contained over 45 million lines of code, which means hundreds of millions of statements!
Google's codebase reportedly has 2 billion lines of code! 🚀

💬 TL;DR: There's no hard limit, but practical constraints like memory, performance, and readability matter. If you're writing thousands of statements in a single file, it's time to break things into modules! 🔥
