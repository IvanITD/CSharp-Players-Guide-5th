Objectives:

1. Make a program with 5 Console.WriteLine statements in it. => Answer is in the folder next to the doc
2. Answer this question: How many statements do you think a program can contain? => In theory, a program can contain an unlimited number of statements, but in practice, the limits depend on:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Memory & Performance Limits
    Every program runs within the available RAM and CPU processing power of the system.
    If a program contains millions of statements, it might run out of memory or become too slow to execute efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Compiler & Interpreter Limits
    Some compilers (like the C# compiler) have internal limits on the size of functions, methods, and loops.
    Extremely large source code files can cause the compiler to crash or take forever to compile.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Code Readability & Maintainability
    A program with too many statements in a single method becomes impossible to read, debug, and maintain.
    That's why we split code into functions, classes, and modules.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Stack & Heap Limitations
        If a program has deep recursion (too many function calls nested inside each other), it might hit a stack overflow error.
        If a program allocates too much data, it might run into heap memory exhaustion.

ðŸ”¹ 5. File Size & Operating System Restrictions
        Some operating systems limit the maximum size of a single executable file.
        Large programs may take too long to load or crash unexpectedly.

    ðŸŽ¯ Practical Limits
    Small programs: Typically 100 to 1,000 statements.
    Medium projects: 10,000+ statements (divided into multiple files).
    Large-scale software: Millions of statements, managed through modularization.

    ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact
    The Windows XP source code (leaked in 2020) contained over 45 million lines of code, which means hundreds of millions of statements!
    Google's codebase reportedly has 2 billion lines of code! ðŸš€

    ðŸ’¬ TL;DR: There's no hard limit, but practical constraints like memory, performance, and readability matter. If you're writing thousands of statements in a single file, it's time to break things into modules! ðŸ”¥
