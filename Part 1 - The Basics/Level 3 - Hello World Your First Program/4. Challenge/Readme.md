## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information
These lands have not seen Programming in a long time due to the blight of the Uncoded One. Even old
programs are now crumbling to bits. Your skills with Programming are only fledgling now, but you can
still make a difference in these people‚Äôs lives. Maybe someday soon, your skills will have grown strong
enough to take on the Uncoded One directly. But for now, you decide to do what you can to help.
In the nearby city of Consolas, food is running short. Telim has a magic oven that can produce bread from
thin air. He is willing to share, but Telim is an Excelian, and Excelians love paperwork; they demand it for
all transactions‚Äîno exceptions. Telim will share his bread with the city if you can build a program that
lets him enter the names of those receiving it. A sample run of this program looks like this:

<blockquote>
Bread is ready.<br>
Who is the bread for?<br>
<b><i>RB</i></b><br>
Noted: RB got bread.<br>
</blockquote>
